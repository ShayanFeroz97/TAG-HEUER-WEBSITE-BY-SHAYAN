        <h1>Tag Heuer Overview & History</h1>

        <p>
          Tag Heuer is one of the oldest watch brands still making watches.
          Founded in 1860 by Edward Heuer, the family business was started on
          the farm manufacturing simple silver pocket watches. 9 year laters Tag
          Heuer received their first patent that revolutionized pocket watches
          at the time. No longer did a pocket watch need a key, only the crown
          was needed to wind the watch. As simple as that may sound today, at
          the time this was revolutionary but Edward Heuer wasn’t done yet. In
          1887 Tag Heuer received another patent for the oscillating pinion.
          This allowed chronographs to start and stop instantaneous. Both major
          patents elevated Tag Heuer as a legitimate and forward thinking watch
          manufacture. Fast forward a century of watchmaking and instrument
          innovation, ownership changed hands for the 1st time. A lesser known
          fact about Tag Heuer is that they weren’t always called Tag Heuer.
          Even though we’ve referenced the company as Tag Heuer for this entire
          article, between the years of 1860 to 1885, the watchmaker just went
          by the name Heuer. Techniques d’Avant Garde (TAG) purchased Heuer and
          combined both names to create the name we know today, Tag Heuer. In
          1999 another ownership change happen with the purchase from the LVMH
          group out of France. Even through all ownership changes, Tag Heuer as
          a company from its inception has focused on innovation accurate
          timekeeping specifically for chronograph watches. Racing is the core
          DNA for the Tag Heuer brand and have produced famous race watches
          along with notoriously complex watches like the Mikrograph.

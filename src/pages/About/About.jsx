          The ultimate reference in luxury chronograph watches, TAG Heuer’s
          high-precision timing innovations have kept pace with the evolution of
          sports since 1860. Our timepieces make it possible to capture every
          fraction of a second of a performance. From the wrists of the drivers
          who have marked the history of motor racing to your wrist, TAG Heuer
          watches have a lasting impact on their time and their era. Shortly
          after its inception, TAG Heuer introduced the Mikrograph - a
          mechanical chronograph five times more accurate than any other - and
          became the official timekeeper for the most famous sports
          competitions. With the arrival of motorsports, TAG Heuer became the
          first watchmaking brand to sponsor the Formula 1 World Championship
          since its creation. Innovation as a profession of faith since 1860:
          from the first luxury Connected Watch in 2015 through improving the
          oscillating pinion in 1887. From inventing the first self-winding
          crown mechanism to the first-ever double magnetic tourbillon. Four
          production sites, our own manufacture: TAG Heuer has continued pushing
          the limits of watchmaking technology with innovations and
          savoir-faire. TAG Heuer has spearheaded innovations that have left
          their mark on history and still define the foundations of the
          watchmaking industry today. Each of our Swiss-made watches exudes our
          know-how and our high precision standards.
